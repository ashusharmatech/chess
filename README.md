This program tries to find all the possible moves of Chess pieces on an empty board.


### Installing

You can run your application using a simple java program:

Main Java class is: [ChessboardTest.java](src/test/java/io/game/ChessboardTest.java)

### Create a JAR file
If you want to create an executable JAR file out of our project. 
```
mvn clean package
```

### Running the test
Instead of running a full build with packaging, it is also possible to just run the test phases of the Maven life cycle.
```
mvn test
```
